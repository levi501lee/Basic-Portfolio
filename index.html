    I have come here to learn coding and chew bubblegum. Does anyone have any bubblegum? Know anything about coding?
    This is not immediately clear, but eventually it starts to click. I hope. I'd like to apply the skills that I learn in
    the University of Utah's Coding Bootcamp to numerous initiatives. I work for a Veteran's charity focused on bringing the larger veteran community
    together to tackle problems big and small. I ring announce for boxing, mixed martial arts, and even professional wrestling. Comedy shows and fun run EmCee work is also a 
    common occurance. Been around the world twice, tried to talk to everyone at least once. Best of the best to everyone. Cheers!</p>
