                    I have come here to learn coding and chew bubblegum. Does anyone have any bubblegum? Know anything
                    about coding? I feel like I'm in a struggle cuddle with this stuff. I'd like to apply the skills
                    that I learn in
                    the University of Utah's Coding Bootcamp. I work for a Veteran's charity focused on bringing the
                    larger veteran community
                    together to tackle problems big and small. I ring announce for boxing, mixed martial arts, and even
                    professional wrestling. Comedy shows and "fun run" EmCee work happens too.</p>
                <p>I'm very interested in building this thing out. It kills me when stuff doesn't align or float next to
                    each other like I want it to. Uh-oh, ended a sentence in a preposition. Better lay some Lorem Ipsum
                    down on fools. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. </p>
                <p> I look forward to leveraging these skills in private entrepenueral activities and also some
                    professional stuff. Best to everyone! Cheers!</p>
